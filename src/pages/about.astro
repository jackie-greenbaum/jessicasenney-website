  <p class="text-3xl w-full font-bold mb-2">About Me</p>
  <p>I was born and raised in New Jersey, but lived in New England for college and graduate school. I have an MFA in writing from Emerson College and have always had a passion for stories, especially about the paranormal. In my spare time, I like going on adventures outdoors, or staying inside with my cat, Piper!</p>
